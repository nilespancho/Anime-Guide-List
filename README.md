# Anime-Guide-List

#### A simple anime guide app consisting of two genres (shounen and shoujo). Choose an anime of interest and you will be redirected to another screen consisting of the chosen anime's rating, number of episodes, date aired, season premiered, studio, genre, duration, and synopsis. 

This was coded using Kotlin. This was a class assignment that helped us practice using lists, diaglogs, and linking two activites using the intent function.
